    The true story of Annabelle began in the 1970s when an inconspicuous doll was purchased as a birthday present. The doll was gifted to a young nursing student by her mother. The young lady who received this doll kept her within her apartment as a decorative item, often displaying the doll on her bed after making it.
    Soon after the doll was brought into the home, her new owner and her roommate started noticing some strange activity. It is said that the doll would move around on its own. This initially started with subtle movements, such as the doll’s legs being crossed. This steadily increased to the point that the doll would be seen in other rooms to where it was earlier left. It was even captured kneeling, which was physically impossible for the doll to later repeat.
    In addition to these unexplainable movements, small handwritten notes began to be found around the apartment. These appeared to be written by a child and contained messages such as “Help me.” The strangest part about the presence of these notes was that there were no pencils or parchment paper within the apartment, so it seemed as though they must have been coming from somewhere outside of the home.

    This behavior both concerned and intrigued the two young students who lived alongside the doll. Yet, their concern peaked after blood was discovered on the doll one day. This fresh, wet blood was present on the doll’s hands and 3 distinct blood drops could be seen upon the doll’s chest.
    This event led the girl’s to make the decision to contact a medium who could assist them with a seance in their home. This was held in an attempt to uncover whether something paranormal was at play. During this seance, the medium allegedly communicated with the spirit of a young seven-year-old girl named Annabelle Higgins. Annabelle had supposedly been killed and left on the empty field where the apartment complex the young nurses now lived was built upon. Her spirit was allegedly lonely and had been looking for young people who she felt comfortable around to seek acceptance from. Being the caring person she was, the doll’s unsuspecting owner made the grave mistake to invite Annabelle to occupy the doll.
